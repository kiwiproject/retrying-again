## What is this?
**2020-12-23**: This library is a fork of [re-retrying](https://github.com/rhuffman/re-retrying), which is a fork of  [guava-retrying](https://github.com/rholder/guava-retrying). We forked it because our [kiwi](https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi) library has used it for years (circa 2015) and for now we intend to at least keep dependency versions up to date, and perhaps make some minimal changes and/or improvements as necessary. We make no guarantees whatsoever about anything. 

Another thing to note is that we forked re-retrying as re-retrying-fork and then _imported_ that as retrying-again, so that it is a disconnected fork. We did not want the reference to the original repository since it is no longer maintained, and therefore our fork will _never_ be pushed back to the original repository. Thus, while we maintain the history that this is a fork (of a fork), it is completely disconnected and is now a standalone (normal) repository.

---

The re-retrying module provides a general purpose method for retrying arbitrary Java code with specific stop, retry, and exception handling capabilities that are enhanced by Guava's predicate matching.

This is a fork of the [guava-retrying](https://github.com/rholder/guava-retrying) library by Ryan Holder (rholder), which is itself a fork of the [RetryerBuilder](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=490) by Jean-Baptiste Nizet (JB). The guava-retrying project added a Gradle build for pushing it up to Maven Central, and exponential and Fibonacci backoff [WaitStrategies](http://rholder.github.io/guava-retrying/javadoc/2.0.0/com/github/rholder/retry/WaitStrategies.html) that might be useful for situations where more well-behaved service polling is preferred.

Why was this fork necessary? The primary reason was to make it compatible with projects using later versions of Guava. See [this project's Wiki](https://github.com/rhuffman/re-retrying/wiki#why-fork) for more details.

## Maven
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>tech.huffman.re-retrying</groupId>
      <artifactId>re-retrying</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

## Gradle
```groovy
    compile "tech.huffman.re-retrying:re-retrying:3.0.0"
```

## Quickstart

Given a function that reads an integer:
```java

public int readAnInteger() throws IOException {
   ...
}
```

The following will retry if the result of the method is zero, if an `IOException` is thrown, or if any other `RuntimeException` is thrown from the `call()` method. It will stop after attempting to retry 3 times and throw a `RetryException` that contains information about the last failed attempt. If any other `Exception` pops out of the `call()` method it's wrapped and rethrown in an `ExecutionException`.

```java
    Retryer retryer = RetryerBuilder.newBuilder()
        .retryIfResult(Predicates.equalTo(0))
        .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
        .retryIfRuntimeException()
        .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.stopAfterAttempt(3))
        .build();
    try {
      retryer.call(this::readAnInteger);
    } catch (RetryException | ExecutionException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
```

## Exponential Backoff

Create a `Retryer` that retries forever, waiting after every failed retry in increasing exponential backoff intervals until at most 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, retry from then on in 5 minute intervals.

```java
Retryer retryer = RetryerBuilder.newBuilder()
        .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
        .retryIfRuntimeException()
        .withWaitStrategy(WaitStrategies.exponentialWait(100, 5, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
        .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.neverStop())
        .build();
```
You can read more about [exponential backoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) and the historic role it played in the development of TCP/IP in [Congestion Avoidance and Control](http://ee.lbl.gov/papers/congavoid.pdf).

## Fibonacci Backoff

Create a `Retryer` that retries forever, waiting after every failed retry in increasing Fibonacci backoff intervals until at most 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, retry from then on in 2 minute intervals.

```java
Retryer retryer = RetryerBuilder.newBuilder()
        .retryIfExceptionOfType(IOException.class)
        .retryIfRuntimeException()
        .withWaitStrategy(WaitStrategies.fibonacciWait(100, 2, TimeUnit.MINUTES))
        .withStopStrategy(StopStrategies.neverStop())
        .build();
```

Similar to the `ExponentialWaitStrategy`, the `FibonacciWaitStrategy` follows a pattern of waiting an increasing amount of time after each failed attempt.

Instead of an exponential function it's (obviously) using a [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_numbers) to calculate the wait time.

Depending on the problem at hand, the `FibonacciWaitStrategy` might perform better and lead to better throughput than the `ExponentialWaitStrategy` - at least according to [A Performance Comparison of Different Backoff Algorithms under Different Rebroadcast Probabilities for MANETs](http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/ukpew09/papers/12.pdf).

The implementation of `FibonacciWaitStrategy` is using an iterative version of the Fibonacci because a (naive) recursive version will lead to a [StackOverflowError](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StackOverflowError.html) at a certain point (although very unlikely with useful parameters for retrying).

Inspiration for this implementation came from [Efficient retry/backoff mechanisms](https://paperairoplane.net/?p=640).

## Documentation
Javadoc can be found [here](http://rholder.github.io/guava-retrying/javadoc/2.0.0).

## Building from source
The re-retrying module uses a [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-based build system. In the instructions below, [`./gradlew`](http://vimeo.com/34436402) is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build. The only prerequisites are [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and JDK 1.8+.

### check out sources
`git clone git://github.com/rhuffman/re-retrying.git`

### compile and test, build all jars
`./gradlew build`

### install all jars into your local Maven cache
`./gradlew install`
